### Definition and Initialization

An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. You can declare an array by specifying its type followed by the name and the number of elements it will contain:

```c++
int myArray[5]; // Declares an array of 5 integers
```

You can also initialize an array at the time of declaration:

```c++
int myArray[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // The compiler determines the size
float anotherArray[4] = {3.14, 2.71, 0.0, 1.61};
```

In C++, the size of an array must be a compile-time constant, meaning it has to be known at the time the program is compiled. Therefore, you can't declare an array with a size that is determined by a variable whose value is not known until runtime.

```c++
int size = 10;
int myArray[size]; // Error: the size must be a compile-time constant
```
### Accessing Elements

Elements in an array are accessed using an index. The indexing starts from 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on.

```c++
int firstValue = myArray[0]; // Accessing the first element
myArray[3] = 100; // Changing the value of the fourth element
```

### Size

You can find the size of an array using the `sizeof` operator, but be mindful that it returns the size in bytes. To get the number of elements, you would divide by the size of a single element:

```c++
int size = sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(myArray[0]); // Gets the number of elements
```

### Multidimensional Arrays

C++ supports multidimensional arrays. These are essentially arrays of arrays.

```c++
int multiArray[3][4]; // A 3x4 array
```

### Example of Using an Array

Here's a simple example of declaring, initializing, and using an array:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int numbers[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);

    std::cout << "Array elements are: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) 
    {
        std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet would print the elements of the array to the console.

### Caveats and Considerations

#### No Bounds Checking

C++ does not perform bounds checking on arrays. If you try to access an element outside the bounds of the array, it will lead to undefined behavior.
#### Static Memory

Arrays are allocated in either the stack or static memory, depending on where they are declared. If you need dynamic sizing, you may want to consider using a container like `std::vector`.
#### Passing Arrays to Functions

When passing arrays to functions, they are actually passed as as pointers, and the function loses information about the size of the array. It's often necessary to pass the size of the array as a separate parameter. 

The following two declarations are the same:

```c++
// option 1
void printArray(int arr[], int size);
// option 2
void printArray(int *arr, int size);
```

The array itself is not copied. Instead, what gets passed is a pointer to the first element of the array. The function receives this pointer and can use it to access the elements of the array, but it does not have a separate copy of the array itself.

If you want to avoid this issue, you can use containers like `std::vector` or `std::array` (since C++11) instead of raw arrays. These classes encapsulate the size information, so it's not lost when you pass them to functions.
