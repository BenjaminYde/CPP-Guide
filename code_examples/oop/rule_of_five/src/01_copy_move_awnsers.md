# 01 Copy Move Awnsers

## The Basics of Copying

### `exercise_1_1`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 1.1
  t1: Constructor
  t1: COPY CONSTRUCTOR from t1
...end of scope
  t1: Destructor
  t1: Destructor
```

The line `Tracer t2 = t1;` is an initialization, not an assignment. Since `t2` is being created and initialized at the same time from an existing object (`t1`), the copy constructor is called.

### `exercise_1_2`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 1.2
  t1: Constructor
  t2: Constructor
  t2: COPY ASSIGNMENT from t1
...end of scope
  t1: Destructor
  t1: Destructor
```

## The Efficiency of Moving

Here, `t2` already exists. We are assigning a new value to it from `t1`. This is an assignment operation between two existing objects, so the copy assignment operator `operator=` is invoked.

### `exercise_2_1`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 2.1
  temp: Constructor
...end of scope
  temp: Destructor
```

#### Wait, what?! Where is the move constructor?

Explanation: **Return Value Optimization (RVO)**
This is a trick question to introduce a vital concept. The C++ standard allows compilers to perform an optimization called Return Value Optimization (RVO).

Instead of creating a `Tracer` object inside `createTracer`, then move-constructing `t3` from it, the compiler is smart enough to construct the object directly in the memory location of `t3`. It elides (omits) the move constructor call entirely.

If RVO were disabled, you would see this:

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 2.1 (No RVO)
  temp: Constructor
  temp: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR from temp
...end of scope
  temp: Destructor
```

### `exercise_2_2`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 2.2
  t1: Constructor
  t1: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR (into a new object)
State of t1: name = ''
  t1: Destructor // This is t4 being destroyed. It holds the name "t1".
  : Destructor   // This is the original t1 being destroyed. It is now empty.
```

- `std::move(t1)`: This is a cast. It tells the compiler to treat the lvalue `t1` as if it were a temporary (an rvalue). It signals, "I am done with `t1`, its resources can be stolen." (move contstructor)
- `t4` is created by stealing `t1`'s resources. The line State of `t1: name = ''` confirms that `t1` is now empty.
- The fact `t4` is destroyed first is because of the local variable called "the stack", a fundamental rule in C++ (variables declared inside a function): Last In, First Out (LIFO).

### `exercise_2_3`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 2.3 ---
  t5: Constructor
  temp: Constructor
  t5: MOVE ASSIGNMENT from temp
  : Destructor
  temp: Destructor
```

- `createTracer("temp")`: This function call produces a temporary object (an rvalue).
- `t5 = ...`: The assignment is from this rvalue. The compiler chooses the overload for assigning from an rvalue: the move assignment operator `operator=(Tracer&&)`.
- `t5`'s original content is discarded, and it takes ownership of the resources from the temporary object. The temporary object, now empty, is destroyed immediately after the assignment.

### `exercise_3_1`

```
ðŸš€ Exercise 3.1 ---
  t1: Constructor
Pushing back t1 (lvalue)...
  t1: COPY CONSTRUCTOR from t1
Pushing back temporary (rvalue)...
  temp: Constructor
  temp: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR (into a new object)
  t1: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR (into a new object)
  : Destructor
  : Destructor
  t1: Destructor
  t1: Destructor
  temp: Destructor
```

This exercise demonstrates how std::vector uses both copy and move semantics, and reveals its internal growth strategy.

- `vec.push_back(t1);`
    - `t1` is an lvalue (we might use it again). The vector cannot steal from it.
    - To add it to its internal storage, the vector must make a copy, calling the copy constructor. The vector now holds one element.
    `vec.push_back(createTracer("temp"));`
- This is a multi-step process. The vector had a capacity of 1, but now it needs to hold 2 elements. It must grow.
    - **Step A (Reallocation)**: The vector allocates a new, larger block of memory. To move its existing elements from the old memory to the new, it uses the move constructor. This is the line t1: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR. It is moving the first element that was already in the vector.
    - **Step B (Push Back)**: Now that there is space, it handles the new element. The argument `createTracer("temp")` is an rvalue. The vector uses the move constructor again to efficiently move this new element into its new memory block. This is the line `temp: MOVE CONSTRUCTOR`.
      - The vector tries to add a new element, but its memory block is full. It cannot simply add it to the end. It must perform a reallocation. This is the critical event. It allocates a completely new, larger block of memory somewhere else. Let's say the new capacity is 2 (or 4, it's up to the implementation).
        - Old Memory: `[ {"t1"} ]`
        - New Memory: `[ empty, empty ]`
      - It must move all of its existing elements from the old memory block to the new one.
        - This is where the line you asked about comes from! The vector calls the move constructor to move the {"`t1`"} object from the old location to the new one because moving is faster than copying.
        - Output: `t1`:` MOVE CONSTRUCTOR (into a new object)`
