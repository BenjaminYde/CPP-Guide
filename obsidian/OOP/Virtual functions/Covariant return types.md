Covariant return types in C++ allow a derived class to override a virtual function inherited from a base class, such that the derived class's version of the function returns a pointer or reference to a type that is a derived type of the return type of the base class function.

Here's a simplified example to explain the concept:

```c++
class Animal {
public:
    virtual Animal* clone() const {
        return new Animal(*this);
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog* clone() const override {  // Covariant return type
        return new Dog(*this);
    }
};
```

In this example, the `Animal` class has a virtual function called `clone` that returns a pointer to an `Animal`. The `Dog` class, which is derived from `Animal`, overrides this `clone` function. However, it changes the return type to a pointer to a `Dog`, which is a derived type of `Animal`.

Covariant return types are useful for the following reasons:

1. **Type Safety**: They allow you to use more specific types in your derived class, making the system more type-safe.

2. **Usability**: They make the API easier to understand and use. If you are dealing with an object of type `Dog`, it's natural to expect operations on it to return a `Dog` or something more specific, rather than a more general `Animal`.

3. **Reduced Need for Casting**: Without covariant return types, you would likely have to manually cast the returned base type to the desired derived type, which can be error-prone.

4. **Polymorphism**: Despite the change in the return type, polymorphism still works as expected. For example, if you have a pointer to an `Animal` that's actually pointing to a `Dog`, calling `clone` will correctly call `Dog::clone()` and return a pointer to a `Dog`.

Remember that this feature applies only to pointers and references, and the overriding function's return type must point or refer to a class that is derived from the return type of the overridden base function.
