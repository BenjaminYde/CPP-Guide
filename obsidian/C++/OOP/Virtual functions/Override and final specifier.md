## Override specifier

The `override` specifier in C++ is used to indicate that a member function is meant to override a virtual function declared in a base class. The compiler will check to ensure that:

1. The base class has a function that matches the signature of the function you're trying to override.
2. The function you're trying to override is marked as `virtual` in the base class.

Here's a quick example to illustrate:

```c++
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        // ...
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {  // using 'override' here
        // ...
    }
};
```

Advantages of using `override`:

1. **Compile-Time Check**: If you mistakenly try to override a function that does not exist in the base class, or is not marked as `virtual`, the compiler will produce an error. This catches bugs early.

2. **Code Readability**: Using `override` makes the code more readable and self-explanatory. It tells anyone reading the code that this function is meant to override a function in the base class.

3. **Maintenance**: It makes the code easier to maintain. If someone changes the base class's function (e.g., by changing its parameters), all derived classes that override this function will produce a compiler error, prompting the developer to update them as well.


In summary, using the `override` specifier is a good practice for writing robust, maintainable, and self-explanatory C++ code.

# Final specifier

The `final` specifier in C++ serves a different purpose than `override`, but like `override`, it's used in the context of class inheritance and virtual functions. When you mark a virtual function with `final`, you're saying that this function can't be overridden by any classes that inherit from it. Similarly, if you mark an entire class as `final`, you're saying that the class can't be inherited by any other class.

```c++
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        // ...
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override final {  // using 'final' here
        // ...
    }
};

class BigDog : public Dog {
public:
    void makeSound() override {  // Error: function override is marked 'final' in base class
        // ...
    }
};
```

In this example, the `makeSound` function in the `Dog` class is marked as `final`, which means no derived class can override it. Attempting to do so, as in the `BigDog` class, will result in a compiler error.

**Advantages of using `final`:**

1. **Optimization**: Because the compiler knows that the function will not be overridden, it can make certain optimizations.

2. **Safety**: It prevents further modification of the behavior of a function, which could be useful if you want to make sure that a certain implementation is not changed by derived classes.

3. **Code Intent**: Using `final` clearly documents that a function or a class is not to be inherited or overridden, making the code easier to understand.

4. **Error Checking**: Like `override`, using `final` provides a compile-time check that can catch potential errors early.


The `final` specifier is a tool for constraining class hierarchies and method overriding, making your programs safer, easier to understand, and potentially faster.
