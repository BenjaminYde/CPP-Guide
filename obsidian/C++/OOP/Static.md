## Static Members

A static member of a class is shared by all objects of the class. It belongs to the class itself, rather than any particular object instance.
### Key properties:

- **One shared instance**: Regardless of how many objects of the class exist, there's only one instance of the static member.
- **Memory**: Memory for the static member is allocated when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends.
- **Initialization**: It's initialized outside the class and typically in a source (.cpp) file.
- **Direct access**: It can be accessed using the class name and scope resolution operator (`::`).

```c++
class Test {
public:
    static int count;  // Static member declaration
    
    Test() {
        count++;
    }
};

int Test::count = 0;  // Initialize static member outside the class
```

## Static Member Functions

Just like static members, static member functions are also associated with the class itself, not with any particular object of the class.

### Key properties:

- **No `this` pointer**: A static member function cannot access non-static members of the class directly because it does not have a `this` pointer.
- **Direct access**: It can be called using the class name and the scope resolution operator, without creating an object of the class.
- **Access control**: It can only access static members (or other static member functions) of the class directly.

```c++
class Test {
public:
    static int count; 
    Test() {
        count++;
    }
    static void showCount() { // Static member function
        std::cout << "Count: " << count << std::endl;
    }
};

int Test::count = 0;

int main() {
    Test::showCount(); // Call without creating an object
    Test t1, t2;
    Test::showCount(); // Output: Count: 2
}
```

## When and Why to use Static Members/Functions?

- **Shared property**: If a property is shared by all objects of a class, like a counter that tracks the number of objects created.

- **Utility functions**: When a function is generic and doesn't depend on object-specific data, like a utility function.

- **Singleton Pattern**: In design patterns, the Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a way to access it globally. This is achieved using a static member.

- **Avoiding Global Variables**: When you want to store data that is global but you want more control and encapsulation than a global variable offers.
