In C++, the `auto` keyword is used for type inference, allowing the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable at compile-time. This can make your code more readable and maintainable. However, you can also use `auto` with pointers (`auto*`) and references (`auto&`) to indicate that you want a pointer or reference to a deduced type. Here's a breakdown:

## auto

When you use `auto`, the compiler deduces the type of the variable based on its initializer.

```c++
auto x = 42;  // int
auto y = 3.14; // double
auto z = "hello"; // const char*
```

## auto*

When you use `auto*`, you're telling the compiler that you want a pointer to the type that is being deduced. However, if the type being deduced is already a pointer, then using `auto*` would be redundant.

```c++
int a = 42;
auto* p = &a;  // int*, but 'auto' alone would suffice

double b = 3.14;
auto* q = &b;  // double*, but 'auto' alone would suffice
```

## auto&

When you use `auto&`, you're telling the compiler that you want a reference to the type that is being deduced.

```c++
int c = 42;
auto& r = c;  // int&

double d = 3.14;
auto& s = d;  // double&
```

## Function Return Types and `auto`

When dealing with functions that return pointers or references, `auto` alone is often sufficient to capture the full type, including the pointer or reference part.

For example:

```c++
MyClass* MyFunction() {
    // Function implementation here
    return nullptr; // Just for demonstration
}

auto myclass = MyFunction();  // myclass is of type MyClass*
```

In this case, `auto` captures the full type `MyClass*`, making `auto*` redundant:

```c++
auto* myclass = MyFunction();  // myclass is of type MyClass*, but the '*' is redundant
```

Both `auto` and `auto*` would result in `myclass` having the type `MyClass*` in this specific example.

In summary, `auto`, `auto*`, and `auto&` are powerful features in C++ that allow for type inference, making your code more concise and often easier to maintain. The use of `*` and `&` with `auto` is generally redundant when the type being deduced already includes these qualifiers.
