`std::array` is a container introduced in C++11 that encapsulates fixed-size arrays. Unlike built-in arrays, `std::array` doesn't decay into a pointer when passed to a function, and it also provides several member functions that make it more convenient to work with. Here's why you might prefer to use `std::array`:

Arrays are fixed-size sequence containers: they hold a specific number of elements ordered in a strict linear sequence. 
### Advantages

- **Type Safety**: `std::array` includes the size as part of its type, so it's safer in terms of type checking. This prevents issues related to array decay and accidental changes to the array's size.

- **Standard Container Interface**: `std::array` provides functions that are consistent with other C++ standard containers (like `size()`, `begin()`, `end()`), making it more consistent and easier to use with algorithms from the standard library.

- **No Performance Overhead**: `std::array` doesn't have any overhead compared to a built-in array. It's simply a wrapper around the built-in array, and modern compilers can optimize it just as well.

- **Bounds Checking**: Using the `at()` member function, you can access elements with bounds checking, which can make your code safer.

### Passing `std::array` by Reference

When you pass `std::array` to a function, it behaves differently than a built-in array. If you pass it by value, a copy of the array is made. This can be inefficient if the array is large since copying a large block of memory can be time-consuming.

By passing the `std::array` by reference, you avoid this copy, making the code more efficient. Here's an example:

```c++
#include <array>

void modifyArray(std::array<int, 5>& arr) {
    arr[0] = 99; // Modifying the original array, not a copy
}

int main() {
    std::array<int, 5> numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    modifyArray(numbers); // Passes by reference
    // numbers[0] is now 99
    return 0;
}
```

If you want to ensure that the function doesn't modify the `std::array`, you can pass it as a `const` reference:

```c++
void printArray(const std::array<int, 5>& arr) {
    // ...
}
```

### Functions for `std::array`

- **`size()`**: Returns the number of elements in the array. Since `std::array` has a fixed size, this value is always equal to the size specified at the type definition.
- **`max_size()`**: Returns the maximum number of elements the array can hold, which is the same as `size()` for `std::array`.
- **`empty()`**: Returns a boolean indicating whether the array is empty. Always returns `false` for `std::array` unless the size is 0.
- **`at(index)`**: Provides access to the element at the specified index, with bounds checking.
- **`operator[]`**: Provides access to the element at the specified index, without bounds checking.
- **`front()`**: Returns a reference to the first element in the array.
- **`back()`**: Returns a reference to the last element in the array.
- **`data()`**: Returns a pointer to the underlying raw array.
- **`fill(value)`**: Assigns the given value to all elements in the array.
- **`swap(other_array)`**: Exchanges the content of the array with another array of the same size and type.
- **`begin()`**, **`end()`**: Provide iterators for iterating over the elements.
